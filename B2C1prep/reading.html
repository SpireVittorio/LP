<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Amid Florida’s Measles Outbreak, Surgeon General Goes Against Medical Guidance</strong></p>
<p>As a cluster of measles cases grew in an elementary school in southern Florida, the state’s surgeon general sent a letter to parents that contradicted widespread medical guidance about how to keep the disease from spreading.</p>
<p> Doctors and health officials typically recommend that children who are not vaccinated for measles isolate for 21 days after they have been exposed at school. In the letter, the state surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, said it was up to parents and guardians to determine when their children can attend school, even if those children have not been vaccinated against the disease.</p>
<p> “Because of the high likelihood of infection, it is normally recommended that children stay home until the end of the infectious period,” the letter read. However, the state Department of Health “is deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance,” the letter, sent to parents at Manatee Bay Elementary School in Weston, Fla., continued.</p>
<p> Dr. Ladapo added that these recommendations might change in the future and stressed that children with measles symptoms should not go to school. As of Friday, there were six confirmed cases at the school, according to Broward County Public Schools.</p>
<p> Measles is one of the world’s most infectious diseases. Cases and deaths have been rising across the globe, in part because health officials have struggled to vaccinate people in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and growing vaccine hesitancy. In January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned physicians to “stay alert for measles” as more cases emerged in the United States, largely among unvaccinated children and adolescents.</p>
<p> Dr. Ladapo, a former clinical researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, has played a prominent role in the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, appearing with the governor at events that mainstream public health experts have repeatedly criticized as spreading dangerous falsehoods.</p>
<p> Since Mr. DeSantis appointed him in 2021, Dr. Ladapo has aligned himself with anti-vaccination claims on Covid-19 vaccines, issuing misleading claims about their risks. At one point, the Food and Drug Administration responded to his claims by saying that such misinformation “puts people at risk of death or serious illness.”</p>
<p> Doctors expressed alarm over Dr. Ladapo’s statements on measles. “He said you don’t need to quarantine, just go out there and infect as many people as you like,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. A spokesman from the Florida Department of Health said that the office had no further comment and referred back to the letter.</p>
<p> In January, Dr. Ladapo called for a halt on Covid vaccines. “Basically, it’s freedom trumps public health, freedom trumps protection,” Dr. Offit said, calling the letter “absurd” and “unbelievable.”</p>
<p> Dr. Nandita Mani, an infectious diseases physician at the University of Washington Medical Center, called the letter “very concerning.” An unvaccinated person who is exposed to measles is almost certainly going to get infected, she said. “It’s just that transmissible.”</p>
<p><strong>How does measles spread?</strong></p>
<p>Measles tends to circulate particularly well in late winter and early spring. The virus spreads when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, Dr. Mani said. It can linger in the air and on surfaces. “Someone with measles doesn’t have to cough on you, you don’t have to touch them,” said Dr. Gary Reschak, a pediatrician at Northwestern Medicine Huntley Hospital.</p>
<p> “If someone with measles was in the room, they left, an hour later you go in and you are susceptible — there’s a 90 percent chance you could pick that up,” he said.</p>
<p> The C.D.C. recommends that children start getting vaccinated for measles at 12 to 15 months old. People who are fully vaccinated against measles are roughly 97 percent protected against infection.</p>
<p> When measles is spreading throughout a community, though, “it’s going to find unvaccinated people pretty quickly,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p>
<p> For most children, a measles infection will be fairly mild, he said — symptoms can include fevers, coughing, runny noses, red eyes and rashes.</p>
<p> The disease can be serious, though, particularly in people with compromised immune systems, pregnant women and children younger than 5. About one in five unvaccinated people in the United States who get measles ends up in the hospital, according to the C.D.C. People can develop pneumonia, which is the most common cause of death from measles among young children; their brains can also swell, leading to deafness or intellectual disabilities, the agency reported.</p>
<p> Health officials usually recommend a 21-day quarantine for unvaccinated schoolchildren because that’s the amount of time it can take for people to develop symptoms.</p>
<p> “You want to keep the schools open, but the minimum you should be saying is if you’re not vaccinated, for whatever reason, just stay home until we get this under control,” Dr. Adalja said.</p>

<div class="exe-text"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>‘It’s cool’: why Beyoncé is kicking down the doors of country music.</strong></p>
<p>Where Beyoncé leads, we must follow – even if that’s nights on the western range, rattlesnakes, whisky and all manner of heartbreak and loss. The Houston-raised pop superstar has expanded her formidable range with the release on Friday of Cowboy Carter.</p>
<p>Where her last album, Renaissance, took us to Chicago for 90s house music, the latest release moves in on Nashville, incorporating blues, soul, rock, R&amp;B and folk, and has reignited a debate over how the country genre treats artists of colour.</p>
<p>Beyoncé wrote on Instagram earlier this month that she’d faced criticisms when she first sang country that “forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me”.</p>
<p>Billboard described the album as “a jaw-dropping ode to the breadth of regional and musical subcultures of the American South” that finds Beyoncé “more experimental and more fearless than ever before”.</p>
<p>Many of her fans were equally impressed. At Revolution Records in New York’s musically storied Village area, fashion college student Cat Martinez, 18, said it felt like country music was in Beyoncé’s roots. She added that the singer, who grew up in Houston,Texas, “made country music in the past but her audience is broader now so maybe it’s more of a shock to people”.</p>
<p>Her friend Sydney Collyer, 19, pointed out that there’s country music on Lemonade, including the strongly country track Daddy Lessons. “I think its interesting her reclaiming being Black from Texas and doing country music. She’s just playing around, and I think it’s cool.”</p>
<p>At another store, Revival Records, beats producer Spencer Lloyd Blake, 29, thought that Beyoncé was not necessarily saying anything with the album. “At this point in her career she’s just trying things out, because why not? Why can’t she make a country album? I feel that if it wasn’t her, people wouldn’t be questioning it. Anybody can do anything…”</p>
<p>But he ventured: “It could be a strategic thing to build her fanbase. Country is typically a white thing, but fans are fans, and nowadays everybody is just trying to boost their streams as much as they can.”</p>
<p>Two songs released before the album, including Texas Hold ’Em, made Beyoncé both the first Black woman to top Billboard’s Hot Country Songs and the first Black woman to send a country song to the top of the Hot 100. Moreover, Billboard noted, other Black women in country, including Reyna Roberts, Linda Martell and Tanner Adell, experienced streaming boosts. Martell and Adell are both on Cowboy Carter, along with Miley Cyrus, Willie Nelson, Post Malone, Pharrell Williams and the queen of country herself, Dolly Parton.</p>
<p>Beyoncé has written that she’d been working on the album for five years, a project “born out of an experience” that she had years ago where she “did not feel welcomed”, adding that “it was very clear that I wasn’t”. She has not elaborated. But she calls her album a Beyoncé album, not a country record, thereby skipping over strict – and dated – genre definitions. In her book Black Country Music: Listening for Revolutions, Francesca Royster said “country had always felt like a heavily guarded white musical form”.</p>
<p>According to Maureen Mahon, author of Black Diamond Queens and a professor of music at New York University, expectations that Black musicians would not want to perform, or would be expected to perform, country are similar to assumptions that people made about Black musicians and rock music. “People have been talking about this for years, but there have always been African Americans involved in country music,” Mahon said. “The expectation for African American musicians is that they function in certain genres and are not involved in others.</p>
<p>Mahon points to DeFord Bailey, who sang at Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry in the 1920s and 30s; Ray Charles, who grew up in the south hearing country on the radio and released Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music in 1962; Charley Pride, whose first hit came with Snakes Crawl At Night in 1966; and Tina Turner, who released her country record Tina Turns the Country On! in 1974.</p>
<p>“Perhaps what’s happening now is that, post 2020, there’s an awareness among some of the gatekeepers to make more space. Musicians often don’t want to be confined to genres. So there are always examples of it, and people are always surprised when they emerge.”</p>
<p>As it was in the 1960s, when country wanted some of pop’s commercial success, the aim now could be to scoop some of country’s market. Country music tours, including by headliners like Kacey Musgraves, Morgan Wallen, Chris Stapleton and Luke Combs, are among the most reliable ticket sellers in the business. Taylor Swift was country until she became pop.</p>
<p>As the Beyoncé juggernaut rolls out to huge fanfare – this time in rhinestones, a cowboy hat and boots – it seems there is at least one holdout. Back at Revolution Records, Olivia Voit said she wasn’t such a fan of Beyoncé’s latest work. “I really don’t like country music, so I would say no. I like her dance music, but I just don’t like country. It’s terrible. It’s just not my vibe, you know.”</p></div>

<div class="exe-text"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>New Year Resolutions: Strategies for a Successful Year.</strong></p>
<p>As we near the start of a new year, many of us will be forming new resolutions in an effort to improve our lives. While motivation may be great now, the road to lasting change is hazardous, especially as old habitual ways make themselves known. But happily, and in contrast, all of that is irrelevant if you have the right mindset and strive to work hard on your goals.</p>
<p>People will be set to make New Year's resolutions as a way of representing a fresh start and setting their intentions toward improving their lives. It also is a chance to embrace positive change.<br />To achieve New Year’s resolutions, goal setting plays an important role. It acts as a guiding compass, igniting motivation and instilling purpose that empowers individuals to overcome life challenges.<br />By dedicating yourself, having strategic plans, and never giving up on your goals, it becomes possible to convert New Year’s resolutions into practical accomplishments.<br />Why do people make New Year's resolutions?<br />People make New Year's resolutions for very good reasons. The anticipation of a new year creates a sense of new beginnings that will be accompanied by a blank slate, and this encourages self-examination as individuals ponder over what they might need to change or improve in life. That is why these resolutions are avenues for setting goals, pursuing self-improvement, and making positive change. Moreover, social media networking has made it possible for people to post their goals and resolutions, hence creating togetherness and support that keeps people motivated toward success.</p>
<p><br />Are New Year's resolutions effective?<br />Many surveys suggest that a substantial amount of people soon abandon their list of New Year's resolutions; however, in 2020, a study revealed an opposite perspective. As many as 55 % of the people polled in this study believed they had been able to maintain their resolutions for an entire year at a time.</p>
<p>What was even more interesting about the new study was that its findings suggested that people who set themselves smart goals and focus on approach (such as changing their sleeping or eating habits) do better still than people who set themselves avoidance goals (self-motivated to avoid something).</p>
<p><br />Ideas for resolutions<br />With the passing of one year and the arrival of another, many people are focusing on this time as an ideal opportunity for a new start. Personal health and well-being are the most popular resolutions by a long shot, but there's no limit to the possibilities — you could diverge from any one of them.</p>
<p>Picking up a new skill, learning about personal finance or spirituality, or just enjoying ourselves more are all ways to live life in fuller measure. The most important thing is to discover objectives that match your interests and desires, then face them with a spirit of perseverance and kindness.</p>
<p>Advantages of setting New Year's resolutions<br />Although they can be difficult to stick to over the long term, New Year's resolutions are considered by many to have several benefits.</p>
<p><br />Here are some of the possible advantages:</p>
<p>*Setting targets and striving to attain them enable you to learn new techniques, get knowledge on different aspects, and form a habit.<br />Losing weight, exercising more, or quitting smoking are among the health and fitness related goals people set for themselves as New Year's resolutions.<br />*Goal setting provides you with purpose and direction.<br />*Setting up and working toward New Year’s resolutions may promote self-awareness and introspection.<br />*Creating New Year’s resolutions with friends, family, or co-workers helps build stronger relationships and connection in our society.<br />*When you experiment with new goals outside your comfort zone, it opens the door for you to experience new things.</p>
<p>The importance of setting goals<br />Goals are the stepping stones to a better life. They give a sense of direction, motivation, and purpose. With goals, we push ourselves to learn, mature, and accomplish something worthwhile. Goals also can help us concentrate efforts and eliminate distractions. They are an unambiguous statement of our objectives, and they keep us on course. The pride and accomplishment we feel when our goals are attained is actually the increase of self-esteem and confidence. In addition, goals are necessary for personal development.</p>
<p><br />10 strategies to achieve your New Year's resolution<br />Here are some effective tips for making a list of New Year's resolutions that will increase your chances of success:</p>
<p>*Don’t aim at setting very high goals that you might not achieve within the period and lead to frustration instead. Rather than doing this, sub-divide your targets into small manageable steps. <br />*Concentrate on making a step-by-step improvement in your life. Vague resolutions like 'eat healthier' or 'exercise more' are less likely to succeed. Instead, define your goals clearly and set measurable benchmarks. For instance, instead of just saying 'eat healthier,' aim to increase your daily fruit and vegetable intake by 50% or reduce your intake of processed foods by 10%.<br />*It is important to know that significant changes do not occur overnight; therefore, it is necessary to set realistic timeframes for achieving them to allow yourself to adapt and change as required.<br />*Consider what could obstruct your progress and come up with solutions. If you find it difficult to keep up with regular exercise due to procrastination, there are ways that can be employed in order to make it more enjoyable, like involving oneself in group fitness or cooking new recipes with friends.<br />*Always reward yourself so as not to lose motivation. Give yourself something for achieving milestones or consistently moving toward goals.<br />*Surround yourself with people who are supportive and encourage your dreams when you feel like giving up. Communicate the resolutions with peers, relatives, or go as far as enrolling in a support group where you may stay motivated and accountable.<br />*Keep an eye on regular progress considering areas of improvement. Keep records of personal journaling through habit-tracking apps among other tools used in marking performance charts.<br />*There is no guarantee that things will happen exactly as you visualized them. In such cases, never give up on what one has already started but only change the strategies where necessary.<br />*Remember the reasons why you set the resolutions and what positive effect they would have on your life. Visualize your life after these resolutions are met, where you are proud of your accomplishments.<br />*One strategy that works for one person may be entirely different for another. Experimentation is important since it helps individuals to understand what keeps them motivated and passionate about certain things.</p>
<p><br />How artificial intelligence can help<br />Artificial intelligence is also changing people's concepts concerning goal setting and the keeping of resolutions. Software tools powered by artificial intelligence are offering hands-on guidance, encouragement, and monitoring to aid people in their quests. Whether it be helping people get fit, change habits, or set and achieve their life's goals, AI is making the human race more autonomous.</p>
<p>From fitness trackers to personalized productivity tools and learning platforms — the applications of artificial intelligence for self-monitoring continue proliferating in our digital age. Virtual assistants and chatbots using artificial intelligence can also offer help, support, and encouragement while providing a sense of accountability in keeping people on task.</p>
<p><br />Avoiding the January blues<br />It is often in January when people start feeling down and demotivated. These melancholic or low mood feelings are what the term 'January blues' refers to. The end of festivities, back to work/school schedule, and lack of sunlight are some reasons for this.</p>
<p><br />Here are some strategies that may help you overcome the January blues:</p>
<p>If you haven't followed all your New Year's resolutions, don't be too hard on yourself. In fact, the best thing is to concentrate on how far you've come and be gentle with yourself.</p>
<p>Engage in regular physical activity. Endorphins have mood-elevating effects, and exercise increases their secretion. Get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise on virtually all days.</p>
<p>Prioritize sleep. Insufficient sleep also is linked with low mood and motivation. Strive to get at least 7–8 hours of sleep a night.</p>
<p>Connect with others. Associating with friends or relatives, and engaging in social activities can also reduce your sense of loneliness.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself. Eat healthy, drink lots of water, and do exercises like yoga or meditation to relax.</p>
<p>Finally, with the coming of a brand new year, try to make sure that you create positive and fulfilling resolutions that bring about an effective balance in your total well-being. Make sure to take things slowly and be more forgiving to yourself as you pursue these goals. You will end up making great strides that are both lasting and healthy for your mind, body, and spirit.</p></div>

<div class="exe-text"><p>Read the following text and then answer the questions in the next task.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>New report reveals UK economy is almost £140billion smaller because of Brexit.</strong></p>
<p>The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will use a speech at Mansion House in the City of London tonight to reveal that the cost of Brexit to the UK’s economy is £140billion, according to new independent analysis.</p>
<p> The new report, by Cambridge Econometrics commissioned by City Hall (1), also shows that London’s economy has shrunk by more than £30billion.</p>
<p> The average Briton was nearly £2,000 worse off in 2023, while the average Londoner was nearly £3,400 worse off last year as a result of Brexit, the report reveals.* It also calculates that there are nearly two million fewer jobs overall in the UK due to Brexit – with almost 300,000 fewer jobs in the capital alone. </p>
<p> The Mayor will tell the prestigious London Government Dinner that the UK “urgently needs to build a closer relationship with the EU” to help arrest the decline.</p>
<p> According to the new research, the economic damage is only going to get worse – with more than £300bn set to be wiped off the value of the UK’s economy by 2035 if no action is taken, and more than £60 billion wiped off the value of London’s economy alone. </p>
<p> In the keynote address to London’s political and business leaders this evening, the Mayor is expected to say:</p>
<p> “Rather than dodging and ducking this issue, it’s incumbent on all of us to have an honest and mature discussion about the best way forward.  It’s now obvious that Brexit isn’t working. The hard-line version of Brexit we’ve ended up with is dragging our economy down and pushing up the cost of living.  It’s making food more expensive, adding to the acute pressures on households and having an ongoing detrimental impact on industries that are crucial to our success – such as hospitality, construction and financial services. (2)</p>
<p> “I’d rather not be talking about Brexit again. But part of being the Mayor of London is about standing up for our city. We’ve got to be frank – Brexit is simply not a peripheral concern that we can leave in the past – it’s a key contributor to the cost-of-living crisis right now and it’s resulting in lost opportunities, lost business and lost income at a time when people and companies can least afford it.    </p>
<p> “The cost of Brexit crisis can only be solved if we take a mature approach and if we are open to improving our trading arrangements with our European neighbours. I agree with the Shadow Foreign Secretary, who has said we urgently need to build a closer relationship with the EU. Because a new settlement would not only turbocharge our economy and help to raise living standards, but help to unlock the growth and prosperity we need.” </p>
<p> The Mayor will also use his speech to say the Government needs to start mitigating the impact of Brexit by tackling London’s labour shortage, taking an approach to migration that is “informed by evidence, not prejudice”.  He is expected to say:</p>
<p> “For too long, we’ve seen a race to the bottom in rhetoric and policy, with politicians blaming “the other” for our problems – playing on people’s fears, rather than addressing them.  This has resulted in significant damage to our economy, society and community cohesion. It’s time for politicians to be straight with the public:  immigration isn’t part of the problem, it’s part of the solution.</p>
<p> “I’m certainly not in favour of open borders or uncontrolled immigration.  But with severe worker shortages, we must be honest about what’s best for our city.  We need both British and foreign-born workers to support our public services, power our companies and drive our capital and country forward.  </p>
<p> “Immigration is a difficult, contentious issue.  But the economic benefits – not to mention the social and cultural advantages – mean we have a duty to craft an approach that’s guided by facts, not fearmongering.” </p>
<p> The Mayor will also talk about the importance of defending London’s values. He’s expected to say:</p>
<p> “We can’t let small-minded politics threaten our precious values and what makes London so special.  I’m talking about our values of openness and co-operation. Of internationalism and global engagement. Of respect for one another. Of seeing diversity as a strength, not a weakness. And of fighting for equality for all – regardless of race, background, religion, sexuality or disability. </p>
<p> “These are tenets that have enabled London to thrive for hundreds of years: economically, culturally and socially. To scale new heights and to become the incredible city it is today – the greatest in the world. </p>
<p> “We should be worried about the threat to the very values that underpin our success and our ability to withstand adversity. More and more, we see the politics of “us” versus “them” seeping into our national discourse, and into the politics of the US and countries across Europe.  We cannot allow it to take hold here in London.  So, for as long as I’m Mayor, I promise to work to protect London as a city that’s inclusive and outward-looking. A city that’s open to new opportunities to increase trade, investment and access to talent. And a city where we keep the promise of opportunity alive for the next generation – so that we can continue building better, fairer London for everyone.” </p></div>
